        <h3>Field : <span> Physics</span></h3>
        <h3>Famous For : <span>The Raman Effect</span></h3>
        <p>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was one of India‚Äôs greatest physicists and the first Asian to receive the
            Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. Born in Tamil Nadu, Raman was fascinated by the science of light and sound
            from an early age. His most notable contribution to science was the discovery of the Raman Effect , a
            phenomenon that explains how light changes its wavelength when it passes through a transparent medium.</p>
        <p>Raman‚Äôs discovery changed how scientists understood light-matter interaction and laid the foundation for
            spectroscopy. He was also instrumental in promoting scientific research in India and inspired generations of
            Indian scientists. In recognition of his work, the Indian government awarded him the Bharat Ratna in 1954.
            Every year, National Science Day is celebrated in India on February 28th to mark the discovery of the Raman
            Effect.</p>

        <p>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as the Missile Man of India , was a visionary
            scientist, engineer, and statesman. Born into a humble family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose to become a
            top scientist at ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) and DRDO (Defence Research and Development
            Organisation), where he played a key role in developing ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.</p>
        <p>He was a driving force behind India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which marked India‚Äôs entry into the
            group of nuclear-armed nations. Apart from his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was deeply passionate
            about education and youth empowerment. His autobiography, ‚ÄúWings of Fire,‚Äù is an inspirational book read by
            millions. As the 11th President of India, he became known as the People‚Äôs President and was loved for his
            humility and wisdom.</p>

        <h3>Field : <span> Mathematics</span></h3>
        <h3>Famous For : <span>Contributions to Number Theory, Infinite Series, and Partitions</span></h3>
        <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a self-taught Indian mathematician who made extraordinary contributions to
            mathematics despite facing many challenges. Born in a small town in Tamil Nadu, he had very little formal
            training but showed remarkable mathematical abilities from a young age.</p>
        <p>He developed complex theorems and formulas that puzzled even seasoned mathematicians. His work attracted the
            attention of G. H. Hardy , a famous British mathematician, who invited Ramanujan to Cambridge University.
            During his time in England, Ramanujan published several important papers and produced revolutionary results
            in number theory, continued fractions, and mathematical analysis.</p>
        <p>His work remains highly influential, and mathematicians continue to study and expand upon his theorems. His
            story is captured in the book and movie, ‚ÄúThe Man Who Knew Infinity.‚Äù </p>

        <p>Dr. Homi J. Bhabha was a brilliant physicist who played a pioneering role in developing India's nuclear
            energy program. Educated at Cambridge University, Bhabha returned to India with a vision to make the country
            self-reliant in science and technology. He established two of India‚Äôs top research institutions ‚Äî the Tata
            Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) .</p>
        <p>Bhabha believed that nuclear energy could serve as a powerful tool for development. Under his leadership,
            India made significant progress in peaceful atomic research. Tragically, he died in a plane crash in 1966,
            but his contributions laid the foundation for India‚Äôs future advancements in both nuclear and space
            sciences.</p>

        <h3>Famous For : <span>Bose-Einstein Statistics and the Boson Particle</span></h3>
        <p>Satyendra Nath Bose was a theoretical physicist whose work led to the discovery of a new class of particles
            now called bosons . He collaborated with Albert Einstein , and together they developed the Bose-Einstein
            statistics , a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.</p>
        <p>Bose‚Äôs work helped scientists understand the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels.
            Although he was never awarded the Nobel Prize, his contributions are considered foundational in modern
            physics. In his honor, the Higgs boson ‚Äî often called the ‚ÄúGod Particle‚Äù ‚Äî carries his name.</p>
        <p>Besides being a scientist, Bose was also a teacher who inspired many young Indians to pursue science and
            research. His humility and dedication to knowledge remain an example for future generations.</p>

        <h3>Famous For : <span>Saha Ionization Equation</span></h3>
        <p>Meghnad Saha was a pioneering astrophysicist whose work fundamentally changed our understanding of stars.
            Born in a modest family in Bengal, Saha rose to international prominence through his groundbreaking work in
            thermal ionization . His most notable contribution, the Saha Ionization Equation , explained how the
            physical and chemical conditions in stars affect their light spectra. This became a cornerstone in the field
            of astrophysics and stellar spectroscopy.</p>
        <p>Saha was not only a scientist but also a science policy maker. He was instrumental in establishing several
            scientific institutions in India, including the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata. As a member of
            parliament, he advocated for using science to solve national problems like power generation and
            infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>Famous For : <span>Radio waves, Plant Physiology Research</span></h3>
        <p>Jagadish Chandra Bose was a true polymath ‚Äî a physicist, biologist, botanist, and writer. He is widely
            credited as one of the earliest scientists to demonstrate the presence of life-like responses in plants ,
            showing that they can feel pain and respond to stimuli. Using instruments he invented himself, such as the
            Crescograph , Bose showed that plants react to light, sound, and touch.</p>
        <p>In the field of physics, Bose was a pioneer in wireless communication and conducted early experiments with
            radio waves ‚Äî even before Marconi. Unfortunately, due to colonial limitations and his reluctance to patent
            his inventions, his work was not widely recognized in the West at the time. However, Bose is now honored
            globally as a pioneer of both radio science and biophysics .</p>
