    <h2>About Us: Inspiring Minds Through Science</h2>
    <p>Our website serves as a digital hub for students, educators, and science enthusiasts. Through well-researched
        biographies, educational essays, and curated resources, we aim to make the study of science more relatable and
        accessible. Whether it’s the quantum theories of Satyendra Nath Bose, the mathematical genius of Srinivasa
        Ramanujan, or the visionary space missions led by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, we believe that every story has the power
        to inspire the next generation of thinkers and innovators.</p>
    <p>Our mission is simple yet powerful: <b>to honor the legacies of Indian scientists and make science learning
            interactive and inspiring</b>. Each profile featured on our site not only highlights the scientific
        achievements of these individuals but also traces their personal journeys, challenges, and the historical
        contexts that shaped their work. Alongside these biographies, we provide educational services such as
        recommended books, timelines, project materials, and external references that students can use for school
        assignments or personal learning.</p>
    <p>We also believe in the value of collaboration and open knowledge. Our content is carefully curated and
        continuously updated to ensure relevance and accuracy. From simple HTML-based science websites for beginners to
        detailed project ideas and research links, we try to serve a wide range of educational needs.</p>
    <p>In a world increasingly driven by technology and scientific advancement, we hope our platform serves as both a
        <b>tribute to the past and a guide for the future</b>. Whether you are here to explore the life of a famous
        scientist, complete a school project, or just out of curiosity — we welcome you to join us in celebrating the
        spirit of Indian science.</p>
